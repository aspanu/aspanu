- 👋 Hi, I’m @aspanu
- 👀 I think a lot about the differences between software engineering and computer science, and teaching the former
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to balance being an EM and not getting too rusty
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects. I enjoy spending some of my spare time working on things that are both interesting and helpful, so hit me up if you have any ideas.
- 📫 You can reach me through my email: adri at nspanu.ca
